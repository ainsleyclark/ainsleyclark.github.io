Ainsley Clark - Junior Developer Website for Founders and Coders.

typerwriter.js - Displays a typing effect on the home page. Tried to implement recursion instead of calling different functions but had trouble.

main.js - Mainly to add functionality for the sidebar, uses eventlisteners to push the sidebar out from the left hand side of the page.

style.css - Adds all style to website including the scroll effect when user clicks on a link. Note - tested on IE and Safari and can't get it to work.
