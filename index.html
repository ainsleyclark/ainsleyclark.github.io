               <h1>My Story</h1>
               My fascination with computers started at a very young age and I have been obsessed with learning everything I can about them since then at every possible opportunity.
               <br>
               My first taste of advanced computing was joining a web club at the age of 13 where I learnt the basics of HTML. I instantly fell in love with seeing the immediate results displayed on screen from changes I had made.
               <br>
               I went on to study Music Technology at the London College of Music. I received a 1st in my degree and was ranked 3rd out of 350 students. Since then I have worked my way up in a high-end Italian restaurant in Central London and am now a senior manager looking after a team of 20.
               <br>
               I am now pursuing a career in coding which quickly became a clear passion of mine from early on. I signed up to the Training Room and have received certificates in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and Software Fundamentals all of which I passed first time round.
               <h1>Interesting Fact</h1>
               I am also a self-taught computer builder and have built numerous PCs over the years all of which with macOS operating system installed. 
               <br>
               The background is a picture of my most recent and complicated build.
